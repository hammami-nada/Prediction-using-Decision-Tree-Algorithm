# Prediction-using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm
In this task,we will create a Decision Tree clasifier and visualize it grafically. 
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier it would be able to predict the right class accordingly based on its learned patterns and features from the training data.
In essence, the purpose of the classifier is to accurately classify new, unseen data into the appropriate categories based on its learned knowledge from the training phase.
